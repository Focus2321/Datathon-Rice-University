# Datathon-Rice-University
OCR Bill.com challenge

I recently worked on this project for a Datathon in Rice university. 
This project was helpful because it was my first time working with APIs. 
I had to learn how to make request to this API in this case was an OCR.
In this scenario, we made the requests with images of receipts.
The idea of the project is that based on the data generated from an OCR, I would need to create a program to convert that data into a more readable form and with certain data retrieve from the OCR, I had to generate 4 coordinates to draw a boundary box on every string of the text in the image.
